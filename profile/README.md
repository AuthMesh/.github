Welcome to **AuthMesh**, an open-source initiative dedicated to simplifying secure, scalable, and observable application development. Our mission is to provide modular, production-ready Go libraries and tools for authentication, authorization, metrics, and tracing, empowering developers to build robust systems with ease.

## About Us

AuthMesh is a community-driven organization focused on delivering high-quality, reusable solutions for modern application development. Our flagship project is a Go library that integrates Keycloak-based authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), Prometheus metrics, and distributed tracing, designed for seamless integration into your applications. Built with standard Go practices, our libraries emphasize modularity, testability, and developer experience, complete with hot reloading, containerized development environments, and sample configurations for quick setup.

## Our Projects

The AuthMesh organization hosts repositories that provide tools and libraries to streamline authentication and observability:

- **Core Library**: A modular Go library for Keycloak-based authentication, RBAC, Prometheus metrics, and tracing, with a developer-friendly setup including hot reloading (via `air`), Docker-based development environments, and sample Keycloak realms.
- **Examples and Tools**: Practical examples and utilities to demonstrate usage and extend functionality, making it easy to adopt our libraries in real-world applications.

Explore our repositories to find the tools that best fit your needs.

## Why AuthMesh?

- **Modularity**: Plug-and-play components for authentication, authorization, and observability.
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified setup with hot reloading, containerized environments, and clear documentation.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under Apache 2.0, our projects are free to use, modify, and contribute to.
- **Quality**: Comprehensive unit and end-to-end tests ensure reliability (>80% coverage).
- **Community-Driven**: We welcome contributions from developers worldwide to shape the future of AuthMesh.
